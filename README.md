# DisneyMagic

We are a group of 3 students from McMaster University in the Integrated Business and Humanities program. With little technical experience, we decided to take the challenge and attend RU Hacks to learn more about how to build something engaging! The photos attached were created through Figma to display what the prototype of our DisneyMagic app would look like and allows the user to interact with the buttons. With the help of Tank our mentor as well as the RU Hacks organizers, we were able to upload these images onto GitHub for your viewing.
